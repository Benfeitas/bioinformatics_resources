## What do I need to know as a bioinformatician working with NGS and high-throughput data?

Regardless of your biological question, it is good to know:
- Unix shell programming
- R or Python
- Git
- Conda, Vagrant / Docker / Singularity or another container
- Working with Uppmax

The following is a list of resources that you may explore. These will only assist you in getting started, and you should ideally attend these courses.

**1. Take a short introductory course** 
- Length: 2 days, doable in less.
